# Autonomous-Vehicle-Navigation-using-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning
This project implements an autonomous vehicle navigation system using Deep Q-Network (DQN) reinforcement learning. The system learns to navigate a vehicle from a starting point to a goal position while avoiding obstacles in a grid-based environment.
